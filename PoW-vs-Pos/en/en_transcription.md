(00:02) in the winter of 2009 a piece of software was released on the internet digital money called bitcoin like throwing water on burning oil it ignited and this is the biggest story of this decade bitcoin sent shockwaves through the world spreading like wildfire and disrupting everything it touched nobody knew what it was nobody knew how to value it and nobody could control it and like any new technology it came with pushback the whole bitcoin market is about a billion dollars it's a novelty for the geek squad on top of all

(00:34) of these attacks critics came after its energy usage that's right bitcoin consumes energy bitcoin in general is wasteful by design bitcoin uses a system called proof of work which requires energy to function bitcoin uses more energy than countries like ukraine norway sweden argentina or the philippines now if you just heard of those comparisons you're likely shocked and here's where proof of stake comes in i think great things are on the other side so number one is obviously proof of stake so much more

(01:09) efficient much more secure much less rekilling thousands of new cryptocurrencies use this new proof of stake model all promising to be superior to the old energy intensive proof-of-work technology there's only one problem is this true or are they marketing false promises one of my issues with sort of proof of stake the way it's been presented and with the ethereum roadmap is that i think that the risks are not sort of fully discussed in a very open intellectually honest way from this video we will see

(01:39) the differences between proof of work and proof of stake the problems tied to each and whether one is more efficient than the other often the advantages of proof of stake are described without acknowledgement of its trade-offs compared to proof of work to understand these trade-offs we must first break down what proof of work is the bitcoin network is programmed to create a new block every 10 minutes and add that block to the blockchain a new block is produced by a bitcoin miner contributing processing power to solve a

(02:09) cryptographic puzzle that the previous block created at this point the miner can package thousands of bitcoin transactions into that block that's how transactions get settled the youtube channel three blue one brown explains the other half of proof of work in this short clip earlier i said that the proof of work might be to find a special number so that the hash of the block starts with 60 zeros well the way the actual bitcoin protocol works is to periodically change that number of zeros so that it should take

(02:38) on average 10 minutes to find a new block so as there are more and more miners added to the network the challenge actually gets harder and harder in such a way that this miniature lottery only has about one winner every 10 minutes what three blue one brown just described is known as the difficulty adjustment which occurs automatically every two weeks this difficulty adjustment ensures the supply of bitcoin remains limited value investor and podcast host preston pish explains why a difficult supply issuance is important for bitcoin

(03:11) when i think about what worked historically before we even went into a digital space the reason gold worked so well is because you know it's really kind of hard to find an ounce of it in the earth's crust because of the distribution of it and what not the amount that there is um so when you look at why gold served the purpose it's very obvious from a scarcity standpoint why and then you look at the work that had to be performed for the shovel or whatever in order to pull it out of the ground it makes sense real fast as to how it

(03:45) basically achieved its value just like gold mining bitcoin miners put forward work or energy in order to mine new bitcoin and just like people value gold due to its rarity people value bitcoin because it's scarce and difficult to find this process is known as proof of work millions of machines use electricity to apply processing power to guess the answer to a cryptographic puzzle left by the most recent block this may seem like a waste of energy but it's what keeps the system decentralized no central authority

(04:17) determines a valid set of transactions the more energy that bitcoin uses the more secure its latest transactions are against most types of attacks many non-bitcoin blockchains have been victims of 51 attacks where a single entity temporarily or permanently gains control over 51 percent of the processing power on the network and uses that majority of processing power to reorganize blocks and perform double spend transactions this shows bitcoin's energy usage compared to the energy usage of some of the copycat networks

(04:51) those other blockchains only have one percent or less of bitcoin's total processing power so if just one percent of bitcoin miners decide to do a 51 attack on either of those two hard forks they can however the same is not true for the other direction since the bitcoin network uses far more energy that shows the importance of network effects and why bitcoin's energy usage has kept it secure bitcoin's energy usage can also benefit our global power grids as macro investor lynn alden explains i think actually when we look

(05:24) out longer term the kind of the direction that we're going i think in proof of work uh assuming these systems continue to be around for for quite a while is that you'll see increasing integration between miners and the energy producers themselves we already see for example early signs of co-location where you have a you know an energy producer it could be solar could be hydro could be whatever and they have bitcoin miners on site you know they often will contract with a miner to co-locate them but they

(05:52) could easily do it in a vertically integrated model where the way that the grid works this is something that a lot of kind of environmental criticisms of proof-of-work don't understand is that the electrical grid naturally has to overproduce electricity right otherwise if we didn't have extra uh productive capacity then turning on the marginal laptop would cause a brown out right so we have to have this this spare production always going into the network and then we have to have a way to drain out excess power that's being produced

(06:21) but not consumed and it's actually this really kind of tricky balancing act and so proof of work systems are actually a really good load balancer where if you're you know the type of energy source that is doesn't have full control over your production maybe you're a wind farm maybe you're a hydro dam maybe you're solar or maybe you you have just kind of your your nuclear plant that just kind of has like continuous power but maybe the demand is fluctuating uh throughout the day right so it's more

(06:46) more demand at evening less less demand other times and so i think over time we're going to see that the cheapest source of electricity is that virtually zero cost stranded energy and the best ones to harness that are the producers or people that contract directly with the producers and go on site and so i think over time that's what basically makes it is as kind of diversified as possible and right now i think you know last i checked the biggest bitcoin mining facility in the world is like one percent of total hash rate it's already

(07:17) kind of a structurally decentralized system and i think it only gets more so as you increasingly incorporate that into production since its inception the bitcoin network has operated using proof of work with no plans to change the ethereum network also operates with proof of work but it has future plans to switch to a proof of stake system but what is proof of stake proof of stake is a system where cryptocurrency holders stake their coins use them to vote on the valid blockchain and get rewarded with more coins for

(07:49) successfully creating new blocks so instead of committing electricity to create new blocks they're committing their stake of coins proof of work is simple because there's no need to punish bad miners that try to validate the wrong blocks that don't fit to the rules of the node network their punishment is that they spent electricity on blocks that weren't valid thus losing money they self-inflict their own wound so it rarely happens proof of stake is more complex because there is no connection to real-world

(08:19) resources without a connection to real-world resources like energy stakers can attack the blockchain without any punishment proof of stake works around this problem by taking away stakers coins if they vote improperly this solution comes with a few trade-offs one being complexity an ethereum developer recently described the complexity issues facing their proof-of-stake system in ethereum's history complexity never decreased every eip is piling on top every major change is one more nail i'm extremely frustrated when a research

(08:52) proposal says everything's figured out it's just engineering now i must emphasize that ethereum is not going in a clean direction tangentially is achieving results but it's also piling complexity like there's no tomorrow if the protocol doesn't get slimmer it's not going to make it we are already past the point of anyone having a full picture of the system this is bad i can't say what the solution is but my two cents is to stop adding features and start calling even at the expense of

(09:22) breaking things there are less and less people knowing and willing to piece together a broken network and each change pushes more away the last sentence should be taken seriously a lead developer of ethereum basically said if the protocol continues to get more complex less and less developers will be able to grasp its complexity putting the system at risk samson mal a developer in the bitcoin ecosystem describes this complexity issue from another perspective there's a lot of problems with proof-of-stake why

(09:54) it cannot work and if you fix one of the problems you create another problem so the general trend is for proof-of-stake proponents to create a very very complex system so that the flaws cannot be easily identified so proof of stake is a more complex system that will take away stakers coins if they vote improperly and has ways of checking to see if they are voting on multiple chains another developer for ethereum ben edgington explains the long-term challenges that ethereum has faced as it undergoes its multi-year shift from

(10:28) proof of work towards proof of stake the reason it's taken a while you know we've relied on proof of work in ethereum for five plus years is that proof of stake is complicated proof work is fundamentally very simple it's easy to analyze it's easy to implement and deploy and proof of stake has a lot of moving parts you know you can code up a proof of work algorithm in 100 lines or so um our current clients are you know 100 000 lines of proof of stake so and i think the theoretical foundations for proof of stake have taken time to

(11:04) mature it's not obvious how to make it robust there are attacks like long range attacks and things which just don't exist in proof of work that we've had to think through and come up with with solutions to so that's just taken time so meanwhile we've relied on the tried and tested proof of work algorithm and and it served ethereum well besides this larger complexity trust and attack surfaces another risk with proof of stake is centralization with a proof of stake system the more coins you have the more

(11:35) voting power you have and those with the coins are also the ones earning the new coins from staking since they don't need to expend resources to stake they can increase their overall staking amount by earning ongoing coins from staking rewards so basically that would be like a political system where the more money you have the more power you have in addition for every hundred dollars you have to vote you would get paid one dollar from the government for voting so let's say there's a high school teacher with twenty thousand 
dollars in

(12:05) net worth if she voted with all that money she would get two hundred dollars from the government for voting whereas if you had somebody like jeff bezos with 200 billion dollars in net worth if he voted with all that money he would get two billion dollars from the government for voting so by a factor of a million jeff bezos would be a more valuable citizen than the high school teacher and he would get paid a factor of a million more by the system for already being wealthy eventually power would likely consolidate with a handful of

(12:38) multi-billionaires controlling most votes and ruling everything if it gets too centralized that kind of defeats the purpose of a decentralized blockchain instead that proof-of-stake system mainly works well for stakes in centralized private property like corporations in a corporation each share is worth a vote for proposals and board seats since the owners decide what the company will do in proportion to their ownership so suppose they are more like a corporation in that case the proof of stake model isn't bad for cryptocurrencies to use

(13:11) for experimentation in fact proof of stake can increase the cost of attacking the protocol since attackers would need to acquire a lot of the coins but of course they'll be prone to centralization but that can be okay if there's competition if their service isn't good people can go elsewhere the creator of proof of work add on back describes why he thinks proof of work outperforms proof of stake when trying to be a money-like asset it's it's a system that works because money has a cost i think money

(13:42) that doesn't have a cost ultimately ends up being political in nature so people closer to the money so called canton effect are going to be advantaged people with the purse strings to create more money have enormous political power lynn alden also takes a similar stance to adam back saying why she thinks proof of stake mimics stock-like assets more than monetary assets right so for if we're talking about what makes a good money it's something that is inherently simple an inherently small no decentralized

(14:13) proof of work basically the the leanest code you can get and distribute as among as many machines as you can get and as immutable as you can get whereas as we layer things on top of it like proof of stake adds a lot of code complexity it also makes it use my prior example more like volatile memory than non-volatile memory needs to be continuously live in order to function as intended and so when you layer those things on top of it i would say that takes away a monetary premium and you you can argue that it adds equity value right so for example

(14:44) when we look at apple stock right so we look at apple stock over the long term you know like this this this kind of meme of ultrasound money for ethereum you have this thing where it's mostly focused on whether it's inflating or deflating and what percentage right so for example apple stock is actually one of the most deflationary assets around it's it's got a 4.

(15:05) 5 average annual deflation rate over the past 10 years they decreased their share account from 26 million to 16 million and that's of course one of the factors for why they did well on a per share basis but at the end of the day what it comes down to for because they're in equity it's the attractiveness of their ecosystem for customers right so it's not about how many shares they have because you have other ones like ibm that are also rapidly reducing their share count but because their ecosystems

(15:30) unhealthy they're not really crewing that value to shares overall and so i think when it comes down to kind of what is trying to be money the thing that does almost nothing other than just be money is the best money and something that tries to do multiple things including proof of stake as one of the components inherently gives it less monetary premium in a proof of work system power is distributed between miners developers and individual nodes your ability to be a miner is based on your ability to put forth money and find low-cost

(16:02) electricity rather than the original miners having an advantage and increasing their advantage over time new miners have a technical advantage over existing miners because they buy newer machines with more processing power if you if you bought a mining rig four years ago and i bought one right now i have it i have a bigger advantage or i can capture more coins that's rare that the new entrant has an advantage over the old entrant right so like you you came into it four years ago it's harder for you to capture and

(16:35) mine the coins and it is for me and i think that what that does and when you look at proof of stake it's a little bit different if you had first access to the coins you now have an advantage over somebody who's now just coming in that's trying to capture them and employ them to the network and so from this system bitcoin mining businesses old and new are all in constant competition with each other this is opposite to proof of stake where there is no competition once you have ownership of the tokens you can keep

(17:07) that power in the system forever plus bitcoin developers went to great lengths to make it easy and cheap to run a full node which allows any user to audit the entire blockchain and reject blocks that don't conform with the rules of the network as a result the real power rests with the nodes rather than the miners if miners try to collude and mine invalid blocks the node network simply rejects those blocks so this system is similar to the us constitution where it has three branches of government you would

(17:38) have the executive branch the legislative branch and the judicial branch these branches would have the ability to overrule each other in certain contexts and in addition to this overruling they would have staggered term limits so this is by design you wouldn't want political people to have power forever you would want to vote them out of office in favor of newer people with new ideas and this is how the us works so like the united states the bitcoin network has three branches that limit each other's power the node network has

(18:11) the final say over consensus but relies on miners to order transactions and developers to create new updates that both the miners and the node network accept many other blockchains make multiple trade-offs including making the nodes require immense processing power bandwidth and storage so that only large entities can run them which centralizes the network into a handful of major providers the point i want to make here is that this is also slippery slope right of course like increasing the requirements by 10 maybe ethereum increases by 10 a

(18:44) year can have an outsized effect where suddenly 90 of the people who would have done this can no longer do it right so it's not linear yeah and once you start going down that path right the reasonable central slope is you're like well you know it's already hard so it's not a big deal we make it a little bit harder and this is why the thought of like increasing the bitcoin block size is so risky so increasing the complexity on the base layer of a blockchain makes it harder for an individual to run a full node

(19:11) and without full nodes the blockchain relies more on trust and much less on decentralization bitcoin's proof of work and small block design keep a lot of power with the individual users the block size war in 2017 was a real world test of bitcoin's level of decentralization ever since the network's early history there was a growing divide between people who wanted to increase the block size and people who wanted to keep it small increasing the block size allows the network to process more transactions however

(19:43) increasing the block size also increases the bandwidth and data storage required to run a full node and in return it puts it out of reach for the everyday user at one point in 2017 over 80 percent of minor processing power the biggest maker of bitcoin mining equipment and a large number of major custodians and exchanges including coinbase and grayscale were in favor of increasing the block size with an upgrade called segwit2x and yet they failed why did it fail because the plebes were against the idea that's

(20:20) only possible in a network where you have so many people running nodes at home uh and threatening to do a uasf or something if if the change proceeds and that i think realistically that would be a very um difficult thing for ethereum to achieve right now because not many people run the full nodes if bitcoin were built on a proof of stake model where the more coins you have the more votes you have on how the network functions the large exchanges and custodians could have used the millions of coins they held on clients

(20:48) behalf to vote in their own favor this is similar to how blackrock maintains the voting rights to trillions of dollars of client assets proof of work and a network full of small nodes are the main way to keep a blockchain sufficiently decentralized and secure on the base layer if bitcoin ever upgrades to a different system it would be only with the overwhelming consensus among users ethereum has also been running into more scaling problems than bitcoin which has opened the door to several centralized and in some ways more efficient

(21:23) competing smart contract blockchains and among those new proof-of-stake competitors there are multiple examples of their systems running into problems one issue involved is solana blockchain going down for 17 hours solana is a popular smart contract blockchain that tries to be more scalable than ethereum by implementing a combination of proof of stake with proof of history to achieve more transactions this higher transaction output comes with a few trade-offs first to run a solana validator you need a computer with 12

(21:57) cpu cores 128 gigabytes of ram and 300 megabit a second upload speed that setup especially the upload speed part basically means you need to be a data center operator to run a solana validator secondly even those data center level validators have to rely on archivers if they want to go back through the full history of the blockchain because over time the amount of stored information becomes massive thirdly solana uses manual slashing in other words it's a blockchain that requires human decisions to determine

(22:31) consensus if there are significant attacks on the network so solana is not really even an automated blockchain it's a step back from both proof-of-work bitcoin and proof-of-work ethereum in terms of automation in exchange for more throughput and low fees the consensus mechanism is more manual human and political smart contract platforms tend to move towards greater and greater centralization because the more centralized they are the more efficient they are and users want efficiency i've not gone to the step of saying that

(23:05) people should have ethereum and it's because of that centralization problem that essentially it's this environment where you're changing the engine of a car while you're driving it so they're gonna change from proof of work to proof of stake it's been it's been delayed for years and because it's a hard problem it's a very hard problem they've also they keep changing how they're going to scale it there's been inventions over the past four or five years that that

(23:28) have changed some of their their base case for how they're going to scale their protocol and so overall my my issue with some of the smart contract platforms is that they seem like they're going to tend towards centralization and and you see that with the solana versus ethereum comparison where a more centralized blockchain comes along that's more efficient because it's more centralized and then people start kind of flocking to it the excitement goes there the the d5 grows a little bit quicker there than on ethereum because

(24:00) there's lower fees and again they don't fully understand the trade-offs but as long as it's working they don't really mind too much as a result smart contract platforms that have higher throughput and a massive support each have a decent shot of taking market share the field keeps diluting itself with more efficient and more centralized networks however ethereum also partially goes down from time to time with unintended chain splits and it's possible that if it changes over to proof of stake it could

(24:29) face more severe issues than what solana faces so overall the main theme is that by not including upfront costs as a part of their designs proof of stake systems inherently rely on more trust and have less ability to recover from chain splits without human intervention many people propose proof of stake as superior or better technology than proof of work and they praise its higher transaction volume systems without realizing these issues many of the things they think are bugs to be eliminated from the system like the fact

(25:02) that a proof-of-work system has a real-world resource cost are features that make it as secure as possible to summarize in a sentence proof-of-work is inherently money-like while proof of stake is inherently equity-like what makes proof-of-stake blockchains inherently equity-like is that they require some form of ongoing governance whereas proof-of-work blockchains are more money-like you
